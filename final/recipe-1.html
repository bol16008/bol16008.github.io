        <h2>Basic Sourdough Bread Recipe</h2>
        <p>This is a very easy recipe, but it takes about 18-20 hours to prepare...most of that time being inactive time
            for the baker--while they wait for fermentation and rising.</p>
        <div class="recipe">
            <div class="ingredients">
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 cups unbleached bread flour (about 480 grams or 17 ounces)</li>
                    <li>1&frac12; teasoons table salt</li>
                    <li>&frac14; cup vigorous* sourdough starter</li>
                    <li>1&frac12; cups lukewarm water</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="directions">
                <h3>Directions</h3>
                <p>Before bed, the night before baking the bread, combine all ingedients in a
                    medium sized mixing bowl. Stir well to combine, but <strong>note</strong>
                    ...the mixture will seem too dry and will not come together as a cohesive
                    mass. This is OK!</p>
                <p>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
                    <strong>Note:</strong> The flour
                    will
                    hydrate overnight...trust me!</p>
                <p><strong>Next morning:</strong> remove the bowl of dough from the
                    refrigerator, setting it on the
                    counter. Preheat your oven to its lowest temperature</p>
                <p>Remove dough from the bowl (preserving plastic wrap) and knead it on the
                    countertop a few times
                    to
                    bring everything together</p>
                <p>Using your hands, shape the dough into a boule (don't know how? Google it!)
                </p>
                <p><strong>Turn off the oven once preheated</strong>, place the boule back into
                    the (dirty) bowl,
                    cover
                    with plastic wrap, and place the bowl of dough in the over into warm the dough .
                    <strong>Important:</strong> The oven is OFF, but warm at this point.</p>
                <p>Wait a few hours for the dough to rise about double in the (turned off)
                    oven.</p>
                <p>Once the dough has approximately doubled, turn it out onto the countertop,
                    flatten it out
                    (removing
                    large bubbles), and re-form the dough into a boule shape.</p>
                <p>Place the boule, top-side down, into a prepared proofing basket</p>
                <p>Spray a sheet of plastic cling wrap with cooking spray and cover the
                    proofing basket
                    (sprayed-side
                    down)</p>
                <p>Let the dough proof in the basket, on the countertop, until the basket is
                    almost filled with the
                    dough</p>
                <p>Once the dough has risen...prepare the oven: Set an oven rack to the middle position, Set a pizza
                    stone on the rack, Place a metal pie pan or other shallow metal pan on the bottom of the oven
                    (for steam
                    later), and Preheat the oven to 475&deg; F</p>
                <p>While the oven is preheating, remove plastic wrap from the proofing basket,
                    sprinkle corn meal
                    on
                    the dough, and place a piece of parchment paper over the basket--generously overlapping its
                    sides
                </p>
                <p>Open the oven, slide out the rack with the stone, carefully invert the
                    proofing basket (by
                    holding
                    it and the the parchment paper) to place the dough in the center of the stone</p>
                <p>Slice the top of the dough about &frac12;" deep in an "plus-sign" shape</p>
                <p>Place a cup of icecubes into the metal pan (in the bottom of the hot oven)
                </p>
                <p>Slide the rack into the oven, close the door, and bake for 10 minutes</p>
                <p>After 10 minutes, lower the oven temperature to 425&deg; F, and bake for
                    20
                    minutes more.</p>
                <p>Remove the baked bread from the oven and place it on a rack to
                    cool...the
                    internal temperature
                    should be around 195-200&deg; F when done.</p>
