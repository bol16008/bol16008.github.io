        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: Handlee</h4>
        <p>This font has a more casual appearance, yet it still maintains good readability.</p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: Lato</h4>
        <p>Good general sans serif font. Easy to read and general comapibilty with many system fonts (like Helvetica).
        </p>
        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
        <p>Want that smell of bread in your home with minimal effort? Do you enjoy a bread with crust so durable you
            could soak it in the tub for a week and still hammer some tent pegs with it? Do you like to hear your bread
            talking to you when you pull it out of the oven? Wonder what to do with that 800 punds of wheat you bought
            before Y-2K?</p>
        <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
        <p class="colored">Naturally yeasted breads (A.K.A. sourdoughs) are healthier than store bought mass-produced breads.  Sourdough takes on some of the unique qualities of your home, because the natural yeasts in each area vary slightly (sometimes significantly). Plus, since sourdoughs usually involve a slow-rise, they develop more flavor and temper some of the qualities which make people avoid wheat bread.</p>
