        <h1>The Sourdough Starter</h1>
        <p>The starter is the heart of sourdough bread. Providing both the leavening and a great deal of the flavor, the
            starter is a little colony of micro-organisms that produce gas when fed, and alter some of the properties of
            the bread's raw ingredients. A starter generally consists of flour, water, and whatever natural yeasts and
            bacterias introduced from your environment. You can start one yourself, or you can obtain specific starters
            based upon your personal tastes.</p>

        <div class="starter-recipes">
            <h2>Feeding a Starter</h2>
            <p><ol>
                <li>Pour off any liquid floating on top of the starter</li>
                <li>Remove some of the existing starter (either to use or dispose of it)</li>
                <li>Add one heaping cup of flour</li>
                <li>Add 1 cup (8 fl. oz.) of clean cool water</li>
                <li>Mix with a clean instrument until it is "mostly" mixed.  It will be about the consistency of think oatmeal</li>
            </ol></p>
            <h2>Creating/Obtaining a Starter</h2>
            <p>You can buy all varieties of starters (search online), and the flavor characteristics of one starter can vary greatly from the next.  Some starters can be very sharp tasting, and others very mild.  If you have a friend who possesses a starter which you find tasty, that is the best place to start. If you get a starter from someone else, ask them how they feed it, and this will give you the best chances of maintaining a similar flavor profile as generations of micro-organisms come and go.</p>
            <p>You can also start your own starter--which seems a bit like creating something out of nothing--but since natural yeasts are all around us, and in the flours we use in the starter, you can create your own--and it may take on a distinct flavor due to your envionment.</p>
            <p><ol>
                <li>In a clean medium bowl, combine:
                    <li>1&#189; cups of organic bread flour</li>
                <li>1&#189; cupes of organic whole wheat flour</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            1
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol></p>
        </div>
        

        <h2>Storing</h2>
        <p>It doesn't take much to store a starter. I use a glass jar with an inverted metal lid. One important note is
            that however you store it, it souldn't be a container that is completely airtight...because a starter
            produces gas, and this gas could potentially build up to pressures that might rupture a tight vessel. I
            invert the lid
            on my container so as to keep the rubber gasket on the lid from forming a seal. If you use the starter
            infrequently, you will want to keep it refrigerated. If you use it multiple times per week, you might keep
            it at room temperature.</p>

        <h2>Feeding</h2>
        <p>A starter supports living micro-organisims, and they eat. To be kept alive and vigorous (producing a lot of
            gas that rises bread quickly) they need regular feeding.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Nuturing</h2>
        <p>If you aren't using your starter regularly, you still need to feed it. First, you need to dispose of part of
            it, and feed the remainder. This ensures that you keep part of your original colony alive and ready to use
            when you need it. If you use your starter regularly, you don't need to dispose of a portion...just build up
            the starter by feeding it after you remove the portion used to bake bread. Over time, an unfed starter will
            transition to a phase where it produces alcohol--ad this floats to the top as a dark liquid. As long as you
            haven't neglected your starter too long, you can simply pour off this liquid and get back to your normal
            feeding routine. If a starter has reached the liquid producting phase, I'd feed it a few times over the
            course of several days to "wake it" before trying to bake with it.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Remembering</h2>
        <p>Don't forget to periodically feed your starter. An unfed starter becomes weaker...and if too much time passes
            between feedings, it can die--meaning you have to throw it out and start (or get) a new live one. I like to
            feed my starter
            every week, keeping it in my jar in the refrigerator (which slows down its metabolism a bit). There have
            been
            times when I have neglected it for a few months, and after pouring off the liquid, disposing of some of it,
            and
            starting regular feedings again, it has come back from its dormancy. I've only had one time in 15 years
            where I neglected it long enough that it all died and I couldn't bring it back. I went back to my friend who
            originally gave me the starter and I got a new "seed" from which I started making bread and feeding it
            again.</p>
