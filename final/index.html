        <h2>Why sourdough?</h2>
        <p>Making your own sourdough bread gives you a better loaf of bread than you can buy...filling your home with
            the heavenly aroma of a freshly baked loaf. You like a good crust--one that "talks to you" when you take the
            bread from the oven? Freshly baked bread gives you a crust that you can't get from store bought bread. Plus
            children love to make bread!</p>

        <h2>Health Benefits</h2>
        <div class="health-benefits">
        <p>Many people that have sensitivities to wheat flour find that they can ingest sourdough bread without the
            negative side effects that normally come with eating bread. Some studies have even shown that sufferers of
            celiac
            disease can partake without issues. For me, I am not celiac, but I do have some sort of gluten
            intolerance--I can eat a whole loaf of sourdough bread at one sitting without any issues. I am a big
            proponent of listening to what your body is telling you regarding the food you eat, and I experiement with
            foods that make me feel unwell...but I experiment carefully in small amounts. If you feel so inclined to do
            you own experiment...start small and pay attention to how you feel. And, if you have ever exhibited anaphylactic
            reactions when you ingest wheat, I would not suggest you undertake this sort of experiment except possibly under the
            direction of a competent physician.</p>
        <p>There are other proposed health benefits to sourdough as well...increased access to usually indigestible
            compounds, better enzymes, you name it. There are probably others that claim sourdough can cure cancer...all
            I know is that I like the eating experience (and it's digestive aftermath) better when the bread is
            home-baked sourdough!</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Delicious!</h2>
        <p>With a soft, chewy, airy, open crumb...and a good chewy crust...toast it, slather it with butter, top it with
            a poached egg or baked beans (or both)... It just doesn't get much better!</p>

        <h2>Easy</h2>
        <p>It is easy to bake your own bread. Sourdough breads rise more slowly than other breads, and this makes it
            possible to shape the loaves in the morning, let them rise nearly all day, and then pop them in the oven for
            30 minutes or so. It literally takes only about 20 minutes of work (including clean up).</p>

        <h2>Essential Gear</h2>
        <p>You don't need a lot of equipment to get started...</p>
